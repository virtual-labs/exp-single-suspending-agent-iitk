<b>Requirements (Instruments, Chemicals & Other):</b><br>
● Suspending agent (e.g., tragacanth, sodium CMC, or xanthan gum)<br>
● Active ingredient (e.g., zinc oxide)<br>
● Distilled water<br>
● Measuring cylinders (25 mL, 50 mL, 100 mL)<br>
● Beakers<br>
● Glass rod<br>
● Weighing balance<br>
● Pipettes or droppers<br>
● Stopwatch or timer<br>
● Mortar and pestle<br>
● Labels and marker pen<br>
● Graduated test tubes or sedimentation bottles<br>

<b>Procedure:</b><br>
● Weigh the required amount of drug powder for all samples (e.g., 5 g of zinc oxide per 50 mL batch).<br>
● Prepare four suspensions with different concentrations of a single suspending agent (e.g., 0.25%, 0.5%, 1%, 1.5%).<br>
● Disperse the suspending agent in a small quantity of water and stir until a uniform mucilage forms.<br>
● Add the drug powder slowly into the mucilage while stirring to avoid lump formation.<br>
● Make up the volume to 50 mL using distilled water in a graduated cylinder.<br>
● Shake each cylinder uniformly and label according to concentration.<br>
● Allow the suspensions to stand undisturbed.<br>
● Record the sediment volume (Vu) at specified time intervals (e.g., 30 min, 1 h, 2 h, and 24 h).<br>
● Calculate the sedimentation volume (F) for each suspension using the formula: F = Vu / Vo.<br>
● Compare sedimentation volume values to determine the effect of concentration.<br>

<!-- <b>Observation Table (Sample Format): </b><br>

| **Sample** | **Concentration (%)** | **Initial Volume (Vo) (mL)** | **Final Sediment Volume (Vu) (mL)** | **Sedimentation Volume (F = Vu/Vo)** |
|-------------|------------------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| 1 | 0.25 | 50 | 10 | 0.20 |
| 2 | 0.50 | 50 | 20 | 0.40 |
| 3 | 1.00 | 50 | 35 | 0.70 |
| 4 | 1.50 | 50 | 48 | 0.96 |

Interpretation: As the concentration of the suspending agent increases, the sedimentation volume also increases, indicating improved suspension stability due to increased viscosity.<br>

<b>Result:</b><br>
The sedimentation volume was found to increase proportionally with the concentration of the suspending agent, confirming that higher viscosity results in slower sedimentation and greater stability.<br>

<b>Conclusion:</b><br>
The experiment demonstrates that suspending agents play a critical role in controlling sedimentation rate. The optimal concentration provides adequate viscosity to maintain suspension stability while ensuring good flow and redispersibility.
